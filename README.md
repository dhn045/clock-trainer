# clock-trainer
Very simple little site to help practice clock reading skills. I made it because I have a watch and whenever someone asks me for the time I
feign ignorance as if I hadn't heard their question when in reality I'm just giving myself some time to process what time it is. Hopefully
someone else gets some use out of it.

To use it, enter a value in the first box meant for hour, then press enter, then enter the value for minutes, and press enter again.
It will change if you got it correct, and reset the text input and remain the same if you were incorrect. It needs to be correct to the minute.

Took some starter code from the following Medium article: https://medium.com/@abhi95.saxena/make-an-analog-clock-using-javascript-7c07580ea91b#:~:text=getSeconds()%3B-,console.,on%20each%20of%20the%20objects.
