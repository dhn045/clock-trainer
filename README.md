# clock-trainer
Very simple little site to help practice clock reading skills. I made it because I have a watch and whenever someone asks me for the time I
feign ignorance as if I hadn't heard their question when in reality I'm just giving myself some time to process what time it is. Hopefully
someone else gets some use out of it.

Took some starter code from the following Medium article: https://medium.com/@abhi95.saxena/make-an-analog-clock-using-javascript-7c07580ea91b#:~:text=getSeconds()%3B-,console.,on%20each%20of%20the%20objects.
